<h1>Disassembling a PC</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this section, I'll demonstrate how I disassemble a PC with another person. I will demonstrate each process in detail and provide screenshots with explanations for each computer component that I disassemble.</p>


<br />

<h2>Step-by-Step Walk-Through:</h2>


<p align="center"> 
STEP 1 (REMOVING SCREWS OF THE CASE): <br/>

<p align="center">Before beginning any work, the computer was placed on a blue material to avoid damaging or scratching the table and to ensure that the work is completed safely and to the standard. Before beginning any work, we needed a screwdriver to strip and build the computer.</p>

<p align="center">We began the task by removing the case's first screws, which were all located in the back. The person removing the screws held a hand over the computer to keep it from moving and make it easier to remove the screws.</p>

STEP 2 (REMOVING CASE AND PSU CABLES): <br/>

<p align="center">We were able to remove the case's screws, and as you can see, we removed and opened this area of the case, allowing us to access the internal parts of the computer.</p>

<p align="center">The PSU was the first component to be removed, so we began by removing the connections that connected the PSU to the rest of the computer. Here, we disconnected the power connector that connected the PSU to the optical drive. It was really easy to remove and didn't require much effort.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 3 (REMOVING POWER CONNECTOR FROM PSU): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eeOSvnB.png" height="30%" width="30%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We pulled the PSU's power connector from the motherboard by gently pulling it, which allowed it to come out effortlessly. All we had to do now was take the supply unit out of the casing.</p>

<p align="center">On this computer, there was only one screw holding the PSU in place, so we removed it quickly and placed it on the side. As you can see from the second picture, we were able to remove the PSU from the computer casing and it came out easily.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 4 (REMOVING SATA CABLE FROM HARD DRIVE): <br/>

<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">Here we removed the SATA connection cable that connected to the hard disk drive within this small box container. As you can see, the cable is red, and we were able to remove it by simply pulling it out carefully. The second image shows how easily the hard disk drive was taken out from the small box.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 5 (REMOVING HARD DRIVE): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J65u9Fq.png" height="75%" width="75%"/> </p>


<p align="center">This image shows us removing the small box containing the hard disc drive. The first thing we had to do was remove the screws on the sides, and as you can see in the second picture, they came out effortlessly.</p>


<hr width="100%" size="2">

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 6 (DISCONNECTING AND REMOVING OPTICAL & FLOPPY DRIVE): <br/>

<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">We proceeded to remove the floppy cable that connected the floppy disc drive to the motherboard. We began by removing the cable from the floppy drive, then proceeded on to the motherboard, as seen in the second image, to detach and remove the cable from the primary and secondary channels, which are coloured black and blue, respectively. Once we detached all of the cables, we were able to easily remove the floppy drive from the case without it getting stuck.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 7 (REMOVING RAM): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TkOjBwY.png" height="75%" width="75%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We then proceeded to remove the RAM, which required only pulling the white clips to the left and right, and we were able to successfully remove the RAM from the motherboard. It was really easy to remove, and we didn't have to use any force.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 8 (REMOVING USB/AUDIO CABLES): <br/>

<br />

<p align="center">

<p align="center">We then proceeded to remove the USB and audio cables that were connected to the motherboard. These wires connect the front and back panels to the motherboard, providing power to ensure correct operation. They came off easily, and we pulled them lightly. On the final image, you can see all of the AUDIO/USB cables that we successfully removed.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8B0ngPw.png" height="30%" width="30%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We proceeded to remove the motherboard from the PC case. The first thing we did was remove the screws from the motherboard using the screwdriver. There were a few screws attached, which we successfully removed. Once that was done, we were able to easily remove the motherboard from the case, as shown in the last two images. This part was simple and took little time to complete.</p>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
STEP 10 (REMOVING FAN & HEAT SINK): <br/>

<br />

<p align="center"> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z6hSlNf.png" height="30%" width="30%"/> </p>


<p align="center">We proceeded to remove the fan and heat sink because they were both attached together. Before removing it, we had to unplug the fan cable from the motherboard. After that, we had to pull the fan stands from all four sides, and we were able to successfully remove the fan and heatsink from the CPU and motherboard.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 11 (REMOVING CPU): <br/>

<p align="center">We then proceeded to remove the CPU which was the last remaining component linked to the motherboard. We removed it by carefully lifting the lever up and out of the socket. It was simple and took only a few seconds to complete.</p>

<p align="center"> 
STEP 12 (COMPUTER AFTER REMOVING ALL THE COMPONENTS): <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qzmt9EQ.png" height="70%" width="70%"/> </p>


<p align="center">This is how the computer appears after removing all of the components and cables. All of the components and cables, as well as the case, have been moved to the side.</p>
